# Highest Number Pairing - Rust Version

This is an exercise to experiment with and learn Rust. This is just an exercise I [first did a few years back to learn Swift](https://github.com/reuschj/HighestNumberPairing). I find it's a good starting place to learn a new language. Thus, here is my Rust version! So, with this I am officially a Rustacean ðŸ¦€!

There may still be some beginner mistakes in here. Feel free to point them out. Also, it's still a bit of a "translation" from Swift at the moment. I may tinker with this here and there (as it's a good playground) as I learn new tricks and better practices. For now, it's a start!

## The problem

Find two numbers that add up to the given number (by default is 8), such that the product multiplied by the difference produces the largest possible value.
